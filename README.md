# Introduction

This project is my hackathon submission for the LLM MOOC 2024

I used UV as my package manager but feel free to use what suits best, make sure install requirements.txt

To run this software please run:

```
python frontend.py
```

Make sure to also export your openai key to the environment

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
The file uploaded to the front end needs to be in the upload folder as well. The sound output will be in sound folder and the frames will be in the frames folder accordingly.

The prompts for the audio generation and text narration can be changed in [app.py](https://github.com/paddelcourt/llm_sport_commentator/blob/main/app.py)
