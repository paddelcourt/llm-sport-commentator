# Introduction

This project is my hackathon submission for the LLM MOOC 2024

I used UV as my package manager but feel free to use what suits best, make sure install requirements.txt

To run this software please run:

```
python frontend.py
```

Make sure to also export your openai key to the environment

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

The prompts for the audio generation and text narration can be changed in [app.py](https://github.com/paddelcourt/llm_sport_commentator/blob/main/app.py)

# Gratitude
